<h3>SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</h3>

<p>"A-hoy!"&mdash;A chance for
any person desirous of escaping
from the <ins title="Greek: hoi polloi">&omicron;&#7985; &pi;&omicron;&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;</ins>, and making
his home upon an island "all
to himself." Hoy, one of the
celebrated Orkney group of
islands, is for sale. This is a
healthy spot, in fact it may
now be said to be most saleubrious.
Information gleaned
from the <i>Liverpool Courier</i>
shows that "the island comprises
40,000 acres, rises abruptly"&mdash;like
the angry hero
of a novelette&mdash;"from the sea,
consists of a mountain having
different eminences or peaks"&mdash;this
piques one's curiosity&mdash;"is
very steep, and has a noble
and picturesque effect from all
points of view." We trust it
may also have a beautifying
and ennobling effect upon the
purchaser. Besides all these
advantages, it possesses a large
pillar of rock, 300 feet high,
known as "The Old Man of
Hoy." The legend attached
to this promontory is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>There was an old party of Hoy,</p>
<p>Who in life couldn't find any joy,</p>

<p>Best congratulations to the
First Lord of the Treasury on
his happy idea of promoting a
scheme for the presentation
of a testimonial to old <span class="sc">Tom
Morris</span>, doyen of golf professionals,
and keeper of the
Green of the Royal and Ancient
Club, at St. Andrews.
An undeviating devotion of
sixty years to the interests of
the Scotch sport has won for
Tom the thankful admiration
of all lovers of the game, and
it is sincerely to be hoped that
Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour's</span> appeal will result
in a bunker&mdash;we mean a
bumper&mdash;testimonial to the
Grand Old Golfic Gladiator.
For the edification of a future
generation of golf devotees
there should also be constructed
a statuette of the veteran,</p>

<h2>THE INTERESTING CASE OF MR. BRIEFLESS.</h2>

<p>I have been requested by a large number of the profession to
which I have the honour to belong, to bring a matter of some personal
importance before the public in an appropriate manner. It
seems to me that I cannot carry out this instruction more judiciously
than by communicating with the Editor of a paper representing by
universal consent the Bench, the Bar, and the Populace. I am
assisted in this task&mdash;one of considerable delicacy&mdash;by a document
that came into my hands at a time when the scheme, now full grown,
was in its infancy. It is a note from "Mr. Senior," who presided at
my mess in Hall some weeks before the commencement of the present
Long Vacation. It speaks for itself:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"<span class="sc">My dear Briefless</span>,&mdash;In reply to your letter, 'No, I
certainly was not joking.' It is true that we four had got to the
third bottle of our after-dinner port; but in that admission I see no
reason for assuming that our intellectual faculties had failed us.
No; I shall be only too pleased if the proposed Testimonial should
become an accomplished fact. To put it tersely, if Athletics are to be
rewarded, why should Learning wait?    Yours sincerely, &mdash;&mdash;."
</p></blockquote>

<p>I purposely omit the signature&mdash;an influential one&mdash;as I have no
desire to bring undue pressure to bear in a cause so purely personal
to myself. I need scarcely say that a Testimonial, even when it
takes the shape preferred by <i>Mr. Micawber</i>, is highly gratifying. But
when the matter was first broached, I had serious doubts whether I
would maintain the dignity of the Bar if I became a party to the proceedings
that would bring it to a successful issue. This being so, I
have little hesitation in laying before you this case and opinion. The
first&mdash;at request&mdash;was prepared by myself; the latter was appended
by a Counsel whose name, if revealed, would carry great weight, not
only with lawyers but the community at large.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="sc">Case.</span></p>

<p>It is proposed to give Mr. <span class="sc">A. Briefless</span>, Jun., a Testimonial,
which it is intended shall take the shape of a bag of money, in consideration
of his services to the Bar. It is in contemplation that this
money shall be collected from the human race in general, and the
British public in particular. It may be suggested&mdash;not that the
contention has as yet arisen&mdash;that there is something derogatory in
a Barrister-at-Law receiving pecuniary assistance from persons other
than those of his kith and kin. Mr. <span class="sc">A. Briefless</span>, Jun., although
enjoying a very considerable practice as things go&mdash;he has held no
less than three consent briefs during the last five years&mdash;is not very
wealthy, and it must be admitted that a grant would not be an unwelcome
incident in his career. For all that he would shrink from
doing anything that might be considered derogatory to his title of
"esquire"&mdash;a distinction that he not only holds as his father's heir,
but by the usage of his office.</p>

<p>You are requested therefore kindly to say&mdash;</p>
<ul class="none">
<li>1. Can Mr. <span class="sc">A. Briefless</span>, Jun., receive a Testimonial of a bag of
money without laying himself open to the charge of being an accessory
before and after the fact of an act of maintenance?</li>

<li>2. Assuming that there is nothing in the first suggestion, will
Mr. <span class="sc">A. Briefless</span>, Jun., in accepting the sum of money it is proposed
to hand to him, be guilty of an act of contributory negligence,
bringing about a loss of dignity to the Bar?</li>

<li>3. Should there be nothing in the latter suggestion, is it desirable
that, instead of a bag of money, the Testimonial should take the
shape of a golden snuff-box, a service of plate, or some equally costly
article? It is strongly urged that, if practicable, this course should
not be advised, as such articles are invariably embarrassing.</li>

<li>And to consult and advise generally.</li>
</ul>

<p class="title"><span class="sc">Opinion.</span></p>

<p>I do not think that the reception of a bag of money by Mr. <span class="sc">A.
Briefless</span>, Jun., would amount to maintenance. But it would be
advisable that the learned gentleman should undertake not to use
any of the sum in defraying costs.</p>

<p>As the ancient manner of paying counsel was to drop an honorarium
into the bags worn at the back of their robes, I can see
nothing derogatory to the profession in Mr. <span class="sc">A. Briefless</span>, Jun.,
accepting the proposed Testimonial.</p>

<p>I do not see that a distinction can be drawn between coins of the
realm and their equivalent. Both are equally acceptable. If Mr.
<span class="sc">A. Briefless</span>. Jun., prefers cash to snuff-boxes, there is no reason
why he should not receive the former in preference to the latter.</p>

<p>I would advise that the Testimonial be collected at once, and presented
as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class="author1a">(<i>Signed</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>I have nothing further to say beyond hinting that the project has
already been taken up with a fair amount of enthusiasm. Many
firms of manufacturers have expressed a desire to send subscriptions
(which they wish to see published in the daily papers) on the score
"that they have been happy enough never to have had cause to avail
themselves of my valuable professional services."</p>

<p>And now I must apologise for so lengthy a contribution. I have
nothing to add, save that should a Testimonial be organised, I shall
be glad were the subscriptions fixed at £1 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Out of that sum
I should, of course, deduct half-a-crown as an appropriate recognition
of the services of my admirable and excellent clerk, Mr.
<span class="sc">Portington</span>.</p>

<h3>HAPPY HARROGATE.</h3>

<p class="title1">(<i>A Traveller's Thank-Offering.</i>)</p>

<div class="poem width45">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Faith! I feared I was bound for that general bourne, which we all must approach through one narrow gate,</p>
<p>But, oh! once again I have felt heart and brain hurried up by the waters of Harrogate.</p>
<p class="i10">(Here's jolly good luck to them!)</p>
<p>Doctor <span class="sc">Black</span> of that place of my bothersome case did <i>not</i> make a muddle or mull, for,</p>
<p>I owe strength of limb, heart and stomach, to him, and those terrible doses of sulphur!</p>
<p class="i10">(And stoutly I <i>stuck</i> to them.)</p>
<p>And true gratitude rules at present my mood (though gratitude's rather a rarity),</p>
<p>And that's why I'd say just a good word to-day for an excellent Harrogate charity,</p>
<p class="i10">(A regular A-Wonner!)</p>
<p>That fine Yorkshire Home for Incurables! Come, ye who've got from the sulphur springs benefit,</p>
<p>And put in your "mite" in the slot, which will quite hold a pound, yet a shilling or penny fit.</p>
<p class="i10">(You just ask the "Stunner!")</p>
<p>The Duchess of <span class="sc">Devonshire</span> opened the <i>fête</i> and bazaar, driving over from Bolton,</p>
<p>The Abbey, you know, a most picturesque show, which the tourist has got a firm "holt" on,</p>
<p class="i10">(I use the vernacular!)</p>
<p>Her Grace by her kirtle had good Dr. <span class="sc">Myrtle</span>, who unto the Tykes introduced her,</p>
<p>And when that she pleaded for funds sorely needed I hoped there were few who refused her.</p>
<p class="i10">(That's neat and oracular!)</p>
<p>The good <i>Yorkshire Post</i> says the Home may well boast of much honoured names as subscribers,</p>
<p>And Alderman <span class="sc">Fortune</span> (appropriate name!) and <span class="sc">Savery</span> (two blameless bribers</p>
<p class="i10">Of folks to do duty)</p>
<p>Spake up for the Home. Shall poor invalids roam, in pain, and alone and untended,</p>
<p>When at brave Harrogate it may be their kind fate to be doctored, and fed, and befriended?</p>
<p class="i10">(By Wisdom <i>and</i> Beauty!)</p>
<p>Doctors <span class="sc">Myrtle</span> and <span class="sc">Solly</span>, it makes me feel jolly&mdash;by sulphur wells made sulphur weller&mdash;</p>
<p>To say a good word! Mr. <span class="sc">Joshua Whitworth</span>&mdash;Hon. Sec.&mdash;is "a jolly good feller"</p>
<p class="i10">(And so's Miss <span class="sc">M. Smith</span>).</p>
<p>The Leeds Engineers' Band was all there, gay and grand, and Sir&mdash;what was it?&mdash;ha!&mdash;<span class="sc">Matthew Dodsworth</span>,</p>
<p>Not lengthily clatters about such Home matters, he knows what a wink or a nod's worth</p>
<p class="i10">(In point there is pith).</p>
<p>Oh, <span class="sc">Myrtle</span>! Oh, <span class="sc">Black</span>! Should I ever come back to that doctor-ruled, sulphur-drenched region,</p>
<p>May potions and baths, and those brisk plateau-paths cure my pains as before, though they're legion</p>
<p class="i10">(And spare me that narrow gate).</p>
<p>But&mdash;here's to that Home for Incurables! Rome was not built in a day, so they tell us,</p>
<p>But Charity always beginneth at home, and I'd say, if Bath will not be jealous&mdash;</p>
<p class="i10">That Home is&mdash;at Harrogate!</p>

<p>We hear that the salmon-fishing season on
the Dee has been a satisfactory one. Some
especially good sport was obtained in a pool
"near Overton Bridge where the fish collected,
when unable, owing to the lowness of the
water, to get over the weir." Notwithstanding
an equal inability of Members "to get over
the Weir," there was not much sport during
the recent Session "near Westminster Bridge."</p>

<h2 class="sans">TORR-RESTIAL NOTES.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/124a-600.png"><img src="images/124a-300.png" width="300" height="220" alt="" /></a></div>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Ilfracombe, just now. If it be a question of
"Ways and Means," then Ilfracombe offers you "the ways" in the
matter of drives, walks, rides, excursions by rail, by sea, likewise by
river and road almost <i>ad infinitum</i>, and sometimes by sea <i>ad nauseam</i>.
Sea-bathing naturally excellent, but still open, considerably
open, to improvement. Still, as the man of no politics replied, when
asked why he belonged to the Reform Club, "There is in this world
nothing so good but what it is capable of improvement," and Ilfracombe cannot claim
exemption from this rule of universal application. Should an
Ilfracombe-ination require suggestions, mine are at the service of
the I. I. C. (Ilfracombe Improvement Committee).</p>

<p class="centertb"><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub></p>

<p>On a bench at the summit of the Torrs sat three Elders. Gray-bearded
and full of confidence in their own wisdom. On another
bench facing them sat a cherry-cheeked maiden of some nineteen
summers, evidently an elder sister in charge of a little brother, with
whom in a shy sort of way, as if old enough to know better, and yet
unable to resist the temptation, she was sharing, with very evident
relish, some succulent toffy recently extracted from one of the many
"penny-in-the-slot" machines, which, as "bits of colour," are such
brilliant ornaments to the Torrs Walks, and such universal favourites
with youth of all ages. The three Elders were discoursing on the
mysteries of creation, with such a "cock-sureness" of tone as seemed
to imply that they themselves had been on some committee of management
when the first idea of making this particular planet, called the
world, had occurred to its Creator. "These rocks," said one grandly,
"were in existence long before the date assigned to the creation."
Whereat the toffy-sucking girl sniggered foolishly as if somehow
personally implicated, while the boy stared, open mouthed, with
toffy, yet untasted, in his dexter hand. "No one," observed the
second Elder, blandly, his eyes on the maiden,&mdash;not by any means
a <span class="sc">Susanna</span> but rather a fairly educated <span class="sc">Awdrey</span>,&mdash;"no one now
accepts the Mosaic account of Creation as given in Genesis." The
boy looked up, inquiringly, at his sister. The girl giggled bashfully
as if, in presence of so much learning and such reverend seniors,
she were suddenly somewhat ashamed of the home-teaching she had
received, and in which her trust had never been shaken, at least
until this minute. The third Elder, his eye too on the girl and boy,&mdash;and
perhaps the toffy,&mdash;now joined in. "It was absurd," quoth
he, supremely, "to believe that this"&mdash;here with a wave of his hand
he took in air, earth, sky, and all points of the compass&mdash;"was
made in six days." Then both boy and girl sniggered at one another.
"I suppose they teach you that all this," said the third Elder,
straightly addressing the girl, and again explaining his allusion to
the universe by waving his right hand about in an all-embracing
gesture, "that this was made in six days, eh?" With a demure
and silly giggle the damsel admitted that her education on the
subject had tended in the direction indicated. The three Elders
regarded one another with a sad, despondent air, as though here
were another case of crass ignorance which they had a special mission
to enlighten. "Why," said the second Elder, "the Chinese"&mdash;here
the little boy became suddenly interested&mdash;"the Chinese possess
records which reach back to a date anterior, by some thousands of
years, to that popularly assigned by Christians to the creation of the
world." The girl opened her eyes, but the boy, having lost his suddenly
awakened interest in the Chinese (probably he had expected
some stories about the war with Japan, or another tale of <i>Aladdin</i>),
had resumed his toffy-sucking process. At this point my companion,
who had been fidgetting on our bench, suddenly cut in and took a
hand. "You remind me, Sir," said he, quite pleasantly, speaking
to the second Elder, but addressing all three, "of the ancient and
royal Irish family of O'Toole, whose records, as you will of course
remember, went back for some millions of years; and in which, at a
comparatively late date, occurred the famous entry, 'N.B.&mdash;About
this time the world was created.'" As this was told with perfect
good humour, and with an inimitably comic imitation of a brogue,
the damsel and boy were greatly amused, and the Three Wise Men
looked as black as the trio of Anabaptists in <i>Le Prophète</i> when
there is a danger of the truth being told by <i>Fides</i>, as to <i>Jean of
Leyden</i> being no heaven-descended prophet but only her commonplace
peasant-born son. So girl and boy departed, laughing, to
gather more sweets, and perhaps to recount at home the Irish story,
which, thank heaven, is more likely to dwell in their memory than
is the second-hand philosophy "falsely so-called" of the Three
Wise Men of the Mountain.</p>

<p>Beware of taking too much of the cream of Devon. "Is it possible
to take too much?" asks my friend and companion, to whom half a
pound of it at breakfast, another half-pound at lunch, and a third at
dinner, are but as a dozen natives, at a single sitting, to a champion
devourer of bivalves. I cannot resolve my friend's question. But,
after emulating, as far as my limited powers would permit me, his
excellent example, I had the following curious dream. For particulars,
see next paragraph.</p>

<p class="centertb"><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/124b-240.png"><img src="images/124b-150.png" width="150" height="265" alt="" /></a></div>

<p><i>The Dream.</i>&mdash;I was seated opposite a lady, popular alike in the
social and political world, whom I will designate as "Lady <span class="sc">Jay</span>."
It was at a dinner-party, I <i>think</i>, though it might have been some
other sort of entertainment, as there seemed to me to be, between
Lady <span class="sc">Jay</span> and myself, the narrow width of a very long table, the
ends of which were out of sight. This table was covered with a
white cloth, not too clean; and there were no knives, forks, plates,
or dishes. The room was inconveniently crowded by persons, inextricably
mixed up, none of whom, however, incommoded
us in the least, or, indeed, seemed to take
the slightest notice of our presence. Somehow, this
struck me as delicate conduct on <i>their</i> part. Lady
<span class="sc">Jay</span> was insisting that an Archimandrite could, or
could not, do something or other officially. But,
having more than once demonstrated to Lady <span class="sc">Jay</span>
that this act, whatever it was, had no essential
bearing on his clerical position, I continued to take
very slight interest in the discussion; at least, I
thought I did not, until, on Lady <span class="sc">Jay</span> suddenly
becoming dreadfully in earnest, and most positive
as to her being in the right, a Whip of the late
Government, whose name I could not recall, but
with whose lineaments I was perfectly familiar,
interposed some conciliatory remarks. Then Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>, in
the absence, unaccountably sudden, of both Lady <span class="sc">Jay</span> and the
Government Whip, strode up and down on the hearth-rug, rubbing
the back of his head with his left hand; whereupon I became aware
that we were no longer wherever I had been until the appearance of
Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> on the scene, but that we were in the library of the
Prime Minister's official residence in Downing Street. I was seated
in an odd sort of spider-legged arm-chair. Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>, bringing
himself to a halt, turned round, and asked me, pointedly, "Whether
I could play the piano." Being rather nettled at the tone of this
inquiry, which seemed to imply a doubt of my proficiency as a pianist,
I replied, somewhat testily, "Certainly; rather better than <span class="sc">Beethoven</span>."
Apparently satisfied with my answer, Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> said
that "if I would oblige <i>him</i> by not continuing my discussion with
Lady <span class="sc">Jay</span>, in which I had been," he admitted, "absolutely right"&mdash;and
here he made some facetious allusion as to ladies in general, of
which I could not catch one word&mdash;"I should," he went on, "<i>have
a seat in the Cabinet</i>." Oddly enough, this offer of his did not strike
me as anything so very extraordinary; and I at once replied, "No,
thank you, I'd rather not." But Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> would take no
refusal; he said, "I have come to a decision on this subject," and
then abruptly disappeared, through the wall. Whether it was a few
minutes, or hours, afterwards, I could not for the life of me determine,
being only conscious of some time having elapsed, before I found
myself in an avenue on the Bayswater side of Hyde Park, walking up and
down with Mr. <span class="sc">John Morley</span>. Our conversation there was, I suppose,
on the subject of Bulgaria, as this topic was continued by us in a kind
of narrow box-room, with hat-pegs on the walls, on which bathing-towels
were suspended; there were also trunks on the floor, and
school-desks all about, on one of which Mr. <span class="sc">Morley</span> rested his elbow,
swaying himself backwards and forwards like a pendulum, while
always talking to me (I was seated on a box), and uttering platitudes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span>
about Bulgaria. I interrupted him by saying curtly, "It is no use
talking to me like that, as <i>I am in the Cabinet</i>." Mr. <span class="sc">John
Morley</span>
was staggered; but, recovering himself, he turned to <span class="sc">Herbert
Gardner</span> (to whom I apologised for not remembering his title, while
he, sitting on a smaller box, smilingly refused to enlighten me), and
asked for corroboration of my statement. Whereupon I produced
<i>an autograph letter of</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone's</span> <i>to me</i>, which
entirely satisfied
Mr. <span class="sc">John Morley</span>, who, having handed it to <span class="sc">Herbert Gardner</span>,
now candidly disclosed the schemes of the Government on the subject
in question, putting forcibly before me "<i>how we are going to deal
with Bulgaria</i>." Not a single word of what he said could I understand.
Still, as a member of the Cabinet, I felt bound to give his
explanations my gravest attention, my difficulty being not to expose
my hopeless ignorance by any inappropriate question. It was with
some new-born sense of importance that I found we were once again
in Lady <span class="sc">Jay's</span> company, this time in her drawing-room, and seated
in a low chair, while <span class="sc">John Morley</span> had brought with him the school-desk,
on which he was still leaning his elbow, and still swaying and
swinging like a pendulum. Lady <span class="sc">Jay</span> was all for resuming her discussion
about the Archimandrite, refusing to credit the assurances
given by Mr. <span class="sc">Morley</span> (balancing himself on his elbow) and myself as
to my being in the Cabinet secrets. At this point rushed in someone,
who was alternately <span class="sc">Herbert Gardner</span> and a <span class="sc">Ponsonby</span>, until he
settled down into being <span class="sc">Herbert Gardner</span> for certain, who
exclaimed excitedly, "I have just seen Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>! He says,
'<i>It is absurd to suppose that his letter ever meant anything of the
sort!</i>'" I quietly demanded the restoration of Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone's</span>
letter to me; so did Mr. <span class="sc">John Morley</span>. The protean representative
of <span class="sc">Herbert Gardner</span> or <span class="sc">Ponsonby</span>, or anybody else, replied
simply,
"I haven't got it." This seemed to perfectly satisfy everybody, and
no further questions being forthcoming, Lady <span class="sc">Jay</span> seized the opportunity
to declare triumphantly, addressing me personally&mdash;<span class="sc">John
Morley</span> and the protean representative having disappeared&mdash;how
she had "ascertained from a Cardinal that".... But what was
the solution of the difficulty, or what was the original difficulty itself,
I shall never know in this world, though I may do so in the World
of Dreams, as here I awoke, and was so impressed with the reality
of the events that had passed, and with the present necessity for
recording them, that I at once entered them in my note-book, and
here they are.</p>

<p>"Hail, divinest Melancholy!" Decidedly the town of Penarth
must adopt this Miltonian line as its motto. At a meeting of the
Public Works Committee of the District Council, a letter was read
in which a citizen complained bitterly of the frivolous name given to
the street wherein he had his habitation. Gay Street! How too
shocking! "The whole neighbourhood objected to it," and not even
the assurance that the thoroughfare had merely been thus designated
out of compliment to a noble lady of the locality, whose Christian
name was "Gay," served to allay the righteous indignation. Away
with the demoralizing title and the base insinuation borne with it!
It was proposed that the street&mdash;being in the vicinity of All Saints&mdash;be
known for the future as "Amen Corner," a name suitable to the
unswerving sobriety and solemnity of the city. The proposal was
put to the vote and carried with only a couple of dissentients. Is it
possible that there are even two Penarthians in favour of gaiety?</p>

<p><span class="sc">A Matter of "Gorse."</span>&mdash;Why will picnicers persist in being
so careless? The <i>Liverpool Courier</i> reports that a party of them
succeeded in setting fire to and destroying some 200 acres of gorse on
land belonging to Lord <span class="sc">Cholmondeley</span> and Sir <span class="sc">Philip Grey
Egerton</span>, at Broxton Hills, in Cheshire. Not only was the furze
completely burnt, but a "valuable fox cover" was also destroyed.
Shades of <i>Jorrocks, M.F.H.</i>, and his huntsman, <i>James Pigg</i>, the
"canny" Novocastrian! Pity, that these reckless <i>al fresco</i> diners&mdash;ready
enough with their indignant resentment if turned off any

opening his eyes he called for a paper. He
eagerly glanced through the columns, and
was absolutely baffled by the nature of their

who had watched his movements, not without

<p>"Well, yes," replied the sleeper awakened.
"When I commenced my slumbers all the

Pray tell me, are the Powers going to

<p>"Why, one subject to the exclusion of

<h2>A BATTLE IN A SODA-WATER BOTTLE.</h2>

<p>It appears that the enterprising commanders of the Royal Artillery
stationed at Dover have recently been getting themselves disliked by
the members of the National Alliance of Mineral Waters Associations
(Limited), by producing gaseous waters at the canteen under
their control, and offering them for sale to their comrades in garrison.
According to a story laid before the Secretary of State for War, the
representatives of the scientific branch of the army in question have
had dealings with the gallant West Surrey and the equally gallant
West Riding, much to the disgust of the trading producers of non-alcoholic
compounds. The 3rd Battalion of the King's Own Rifle
Corps (late 60th) are also at Dover, but there is no evidence to
show that these warriors have preferred "R. A. aërateds" to
brands as yet better known to the consumers of effervescing
drinks. According to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, this labour, savouring
more of peace than of war, enabled the controllers of the cannon to
contribute some £40 in prizes to the garrison sports held at Dover on
Saturday last. Whether the financial game was worth the athletic
candle is a matter that must be decided by military experts qualified
to weigh the respective advantages of burning "villainous
saltpetre" and preparing that exhilarating liquid known amongst
civilians as "fizzle." Admittedly, lemonade and its companion
"ginger pop" when they scintillate are grateful drinks, but it would
scarcely be advisable if through the, no doubt, well intentioned efforts
of those concerned, the Royal Artillery gained an equally appropriate
but less impressive designation. It would indeed be a sad thing if it
ever became necessary for some General to have to sing out, "Here,
you Sir, in command of those Royal Ginger Popgunners, limber up
your soda-water manufacturing apparatus and retire at the gallop to
the canteen in the rear!" Such a direction, if delivered in the piping
time of peace would sound incongruous, and might predict disaster if
uttered in the hideous hour of war.</p>

<p>I have just finished <i>Napoléon et les femmes</i>, by <span class="sc">Fredéric Masson</span>.
On the cover is "<i>dix-huitième édition</i>," which shows what a success
the book has obtained. The author is an apologist for <span class="sc">Napoleon</span>.
The Emperor can do no wrong. What in the private individual is
rank blasphemy, is, to this author, in the
Emperor only a pardonable weakness.
Whatever <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> may have been as
the "Man of Destiny" and as the greatest
military genius of his time, he was, if
most of these stories be true, as a man, a
satyr, a cad (there is no other English
word for it), and a snob. Satyr he was
apparently always; satyr and cad in certain
instances, especially as regards the
"<span class="sc">Walewska</span> affair," in which so many
personages took part; everyone of them
outraging morality, and all disregarding
the sacredness of marriage; though to
Madame <span class="sc">Walewska</span> herself must be apportioned
the least share of the guilt in
which all were steeped up to the hilt. Madame <span class="sc">Walewska</span> yielded
herself as a victim to a most cruel combination of circumstances; and
of this <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> availed himself to the utmost. It was in his power
to have behaved as a gentleman for once, but he allowed the opportunity
to slip. That he appears, on one occasion, to have permitted
a poor terrified, artless victim to escape is put forward triumphantly
by his apologist as a proof of his magnanimity; but even a
satiated animal will refuse food, though if the food be in his possession
he will play the dog in the manger. He had a tigerish admiration
for the deepest tragedy, and abhorred farce and comedy. He
could play like a child with the one child of whom he hoped great
things. Cad he was always, in his dealings with men and women.
As an imperial cad he was toadied by his grovelling courtiers; but
when there is much to be gained by toadying a cad, and everything
to lose by not toadying him, all will be toadies from the
highest to the lowest. The exceptions are rare. A thorough snob
did "the Corsican upstart" show himself in his eager anxiety for
recognition by the royal and aristocratic families of Europe, and by
his servility to the Austrian <span class="sc">Emperor</span>, in order to obtain the hand
of the high-born <span class="sc">Marie-Louise</span>. If ever tyrant deserved defeat and
disgrace <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> did so. Like Cardinal <span class="sc">Wolsey</span>, what "best
became
him in his life was the leaving of it." Those interested, and
who is not, in "the <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> Legend," should not fail to read this
book, says</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">The Studious Baron de Book-Worms</span>.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>The annual "Timmer" Market, or Timber Fair, has been waking
the echoes of sober Aberdeen "with lively din." The Aberdonian
youth, so says the <i>Daily Free Press</i>, "shook the nerves of peace-loving
citizens by the hideous and discordant noise of tin trumpets
and corncrakes." This is odd, for one might imagine that the Caledonian
ear, which attunes itself so easily, willingly, and often to
the screeches of that national instrument of torture the bagpipe,
would hail the comparatively soothing strains of tin trumpet and
corncrake with eager enthusiasm. Not so, however. For the "bra'
laddie" the <i>only</i> music is that which is emitted by the bagpipe. It
appeals to his delicate artistic sense, and, like a much advertised
remedy, "it touches the spot." <i>Vive la bag(pipe)atelle!</i></p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="title1">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 530px;"><a href="images/131a-1500.png"><img src="images/131a-530.png" width="530" height="467" alt="When in doubt, consult the Cap'en." /></a>
<p class="center">When in doubt, consult the Cap'en.</p></div>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, September 2.</i>&mdash;A sight for Lords
and Commons to see Lord High Admiral <span class="sc">Jokim</span> seated between
Cap'en <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> and <span class="sc">Arnold-Forster</span>, imbibing naval
information
at the pores, as <i>Joey Ladle</i>, in far-off-days, deep in the
recesses of his employer's cellar, took his spirituous refreshment.</p>

<p>"How happy could I be with either were t'other instructor
away," said <span class="sc">Jokim</span>, rubbing his pleased sides with rapturous
content. "Or, happier still," he added, <i>sotto voce</i>, "if both would
take themselves off."</p>

<p>In his secret heart the <span class="sc">Cap'en</span> looks upon <span class="sc">Arnold-Forster</span> as a
landlubber.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't," he says, with fine scorn, "know how to belay a
sheet when a ship was stepping fore and aft under a booming north-wester.
I'd lay a rope's end to a bumboat-man's back that he
couldn't pass a spare spar through the man-hole without first pulling
up the trysail."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arnold-Forster</span>, on his part, suspects the <span class="sc">Cap'en</span> hasn't seen
nearly so much of the wild ocean as casual observations dropped by
him may indicate. He makes much of certain variations in the old
salt's story of how he came to lose his hand in the service of his
country. There is, certainly, some doubt as to whether it was the
Prince Consort or <span class="sc">Albert</span> Prince of Wales who sent him that
famous letter accompanying the hook which at this day enables the
<span class="sc">Cap'en</span> to overhaul the estimates. But this is due rather to wealth
of experience than to poverty of veracity. When a man has seen
everything, gone so far, and knows so much as <span class="sc">Tommy</span>, he may be
forgiven if occasionally he mixes up a name or two, a date, or an
episode.</p>

<p>Some uneasiness in ministerial circles last week upon observation
of <span class="sc">Macartney</span> going about his country's business in white ducks.
These are, so to speak, Cap'en <span class="sc">Tommy's</span> colours. Always ducks
them when he goes on the warpath against the Admiralty. For
the Secretary of all men, he the only man, to follow <span class="sc">Tommy's</span>
example in this respect didn't look well. Was said to be a hint to
whom it might concern that if the department didn't treat him with
more respect, <span class="sc">Macartney</span> would carry over to the enemy his stored
wealth of naval knowledge. Since Private <span class="sc">Hanbury</span> got his
stripes, and is now referred to in debate as "The Honourable
Corporal," <span class="sc">Cap'en</span> has no party. With <span class="sc">Macartney</span> forming the
nucleus of one, who knows what might not happen?</p>

<p>House relieved to-night to find Secretary to Admiralty has hauled
down sign of revolt, and put on
ordinary trousers. If there was anything
in the incident, all is well
now. That there may have been
appears from the <span class="sc">Cap'en's</span> unusually
embittered tone when the
subject is alluded to.</p>

<p>"Call <i>them</i> ducks!" he cried in
scorn. "They were only white
drawers. No member of this House
should attempt to walk up the floor
in ducks unless he is prepared to
keep on his domestic staff a man
who has made the garment a life-long
study; who knows how to wash
it, starch it, iron it, and, above all,
to fold it up."</p>

<p>"Swaziland,&nbsp;my&nbsp;Swaziland."</p></div>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;One decided advantage
of change of position of sections of
parties on formation of new Ministry
is to bring <span class="sc">Silomio</span> within reach of
<span class="sc">Hemprer Joe's</span> knobstick. In last
Parliament, united against common
enemy, <span class="sc">Silomio</span> was most deferential
to "my right hon. friend,"
while <span class="sc">Joseph's</span> respect for patriotic
instinct of Swazi Chief, whose
fathers, having come over with the
Conqueror, went out in the <i>Mayflower</i>,
was sometimes past expression.
Now <span class="sc">Hemprer Joe</span> has come
into his kingdom; his knobstick is
exchanged for a sceptre, whilst
<span class="sc">Silomio</span> begins to realise something
of the feelings of the Red Man when
harried by his haughty ancestors.
Like him, <span class="sc">Silomio's</span> possessions are
taken from him. His Civil Lordship
of the Admiralty is given to another,
and that other the son of his former
trusted right hon. friend.
When, therefore, to-night
<span class="sc">Silomio</span>, from his arid exile
below the gangway, sings
again his old song with its
low lament&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width15">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Swaziland, my Swaziland!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and when <span class="sc">Hemprer Joe</span>, to
the delight of scoffers opposite,
rolls him over and over,
pinks his fluffy eloquence with
scornful stiletto, no wonder he
turns at bay, and reminds
<span class="sc">L'Hemprer</span> of things he said
about <span class="sc">Hercules Robinson</span> at
a time he sat untrammelled
on Opposition benches.</p>

<p>Shaft goes home. <span class="sc">L'Hemprer</span>
very angry. "A statement
that ought not to be
made," he says, withering
<span class="sc">Silomio</span> with direful look.
Ministerialists loyally cheer;
Opposition lightly laugh;
<span class="sc">Silomio</span>, buffeted on all sides,
comforts himself with thoughts
of faithful friends in far-off
Swaziland. There is at least
one spot on earth where he is
appreciated. Soon he may
shake off from his mocassins
the dust of civilisation, and
hie him thither.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Lo! the poor Indian Budget at last. 'Tis the poor
relation of Parliamentary Bills. At commencement of every Session
Members interested in India protest against Budget being postponed
till very last hours, when most people are gone away, and those who
remain are hopelessly weary. <span class="sc">Secretary of State</span> promises amendment.
Here we are something later than usual. Yesterday's sitting
was solemnly set apart for Indian Budget. Other things&mdash;Chitral,
Cotton Duties&mdash;crowded it out. Meekly looks in to-day, hoping it
doesn't intrude.</p>

<p>Strange peace fallen over House. <span class="sc">Georgie Hamilton's</span> voice
echoes over spaces desolate as the outlook of the rupee. Not a single
Irish Member left to object to anything. For them the scene of
conflict is transferred to Ireland. There the inoffensive <span class="sc">Tim</span> stands at
bay, <span class="sc">Justin McCarthy</span> having at length dealt him that "good hard
knock" the imminence of which E. R. lately forecast in these prophetic
pages. There <span class="sc">William O'Brien</span>, with wet handkerchief
mopping wetter eyes, tells stories out of school of <span class="sc">Tim's</span> unnatural
naughtiness when good Mr. G. was bringing in his Home-Rule Bill,
and upon other enticing occasions. There patriots bang their
brothers in pursuit of peace, and hate each other for the love of
Ireland.</p>

<h2>ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</h2>

<p>In the London correspondence of a provincial paper it is stated
that "Lord <span class="sc">Hothfield</span>, who recently gave up the errors and
heresies of Liberalism to seek security in Conservatism, has been
elected a member of the Carlton. His characteristic exclamation on
entering the club the first time after his election was, 'Thank God,
I can now have a quiet game of whist,' meaning I suppose, that his
mind was now at rest." This explanation of Lord <span class="sc">Hothfield's</span>
meaning does credit to the ingenuity of the correspondent. It is a
sublime spectacle, that of a Radical peer forswearing his errors
merely that he may have a quiet game of whist at the Carlton.

<p>I have been reading about the harvest festivals
with which the country has been lately teeming.
They are all made on one pattern. The interior
of the building is very tastefully adorned with
fruit and foliage, supplied by friends connected
with the church and others. The subject of one
reverend gentleman's discourse in the morning is,
"Put in the sickle." In the afternoon another
reverend gentleman discourses on "A stroll
through a corn-field," and in the evening a third
clergyman poses his congregation with the
question, "What shall be done with the
tares?" Thank-offerings in aid of the church
funds are then taken, the choir sings special
harvest hymns, and somebody invariably "presides"
at the organ.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>The temptations of the fruit are sometimes, I am sorry to say,
irresistible. I have seen an absent-minded landed proprietor steadily
pluck and eat his way through a whole bunch of grapes, while the
preacher held forth on the symbolic meaning attached to fruit. The
attention of the congregation, I need hardly say, was breathlessly
concentrated not on the preacher, but on the devourer of the grapes.
At a festival I attended last year, the fruits of the earth were
represented by dead rabbits on the window-sills of the church.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>By the way, why does one always "preside" at the organ? At
the first blush there would not seem to be anything peculiarly
presidential about the playing of the instrument, but then I may be
dull. For instance, I have never yet understood why young
tobacconists are always alluded to as "commencing." Other traders
are content to begin or to start, but a tobacconist must apparently
"commence" or be eternally disgraced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Blackburn</span> has been visiting Manchester and Liverpool,
and has confided his impressions of these great cities to the
editor of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>. He admires Manchester for
"its admirable tramway, street police, and other traffic arrangements,"
but there is an <i>amari aliquid</i> in the shape of the Manchester
street Arab. Mr. <span class="sc">Blackburn</span> has all an artist's tolerance; but, as
might be expected of a black and white artist, he feels bound to draw
the line, and he draws it before street Arabs. He thinks it worth
while to mention&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"A pedestrian's experience of his, generally, free fight with the street
<i>gamin</i> culminating on Saturday afternoon last at 2.15 by being tripped up
and thrown down in the middle of the road near the Central Station, and only
saved from further contact with the said tramcars by rolling quickly round
and round into the gutter. This rapid act was witnessed, doubtless, by
several of your readers, two of whom rendered timely assistance. I am aware
that it is the rule in any household or community for a guest to conform to
its ways for the time being, and not to complain of any <i>contretemps</i>; but,
having had a second encounter (of less consequence) on the very steps of the
entrance to the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, on the same afternoon, I
venture to think that the juvenile&mdash;and in some respects perfectly delightful&mdash;street
vendors of matches, flowers, and football newspapers have a little too
much of a free run in both these cities."

<p><span class="sc">At Last.</span>&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Lane</span>, the Magistrate, appealed to by an Indian
gentleman as to whether he&mdash;the I. G.&mdash;might "turn round upon"
rude street-boys, who called him "Lulali," and asked whether he&mdash;the
Magistrate&mdash;would like it himself, replied that he had lived too
long in the world to care about such matters. This imperturbable
"Beak" is evidently then&mdash;at last&mdash;the often-talked-of "Long Lane
that has no turning."</p>
